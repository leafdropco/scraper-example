- npm i
- ionic serve

## node only

# errors & goals
If you run the front/backend section youll get a cors error that i couldn't solve. I found this example online to try to get a solid starting point.

The node folder is something I hacked together that has a decent starting point but i dont know how to integrate it with cloud functions or an angular pwa front end.

I've never built a backend before so I seem to be missing some of the integraton pieces of this.

Ultimately I'd like to build an app/scraper that can do the following:
- compare two (or multiple) instagram pages data
- have a backend the pulls name, following, posts, post data from and instagram username and feeds that data to a database
- the front end will be an angular pwa

Any help or suggestions on what you think the smartest way to go about this is would be greatly appreciated
